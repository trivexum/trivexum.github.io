            <h4 class="title">TRIVEXUM Update: New Theme + Portfolio Website Project!</h4>

            <h3>Hey there, fellow devs! 👋</h3>
            <p>We’re pumped to roll out a fresh new look for <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Project
                    Portico</span>, powered by a clean,
                modern theme that makes your projects shine brighter than your code on deadline night! Plus — drumroll,
                please — we just dropped
                a <b>brand new Portfolio Website project</b> that’s perfect for showing off your skills and projects in
                style. 💼✨
            </p>

            <h3>What’s the New Theme?</h3>
            <p>The whole site now rocks these chill vibes:</p>
            <pre style="background: var(--color-bg); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
<code>:root {
  --color-bg: #f9f9f9;
  --color-primary: #34495e;
  --color-secondary: #2c3e50;
  --color-accent: #2980b9;
  --color-text: #2d3436;
  --color-light-text: #7f8c8d;
  --color-border: #dfe6e9;
  --color-white: #ffffff;
}
</code>
    </pre>
            <p>Simple, sleek, and easy on the eyes — just how a portfolio should be!</p>

            <h3>Meet the Portfolio Project 🚀</h3>
            <p>This project is your personal brand’s new BFF — a minimalist portfolio website that highlights your best
                work, your story,
                and your contact info. Whether you’re pitching clients or just showing off your progress, this site
                keeps it professional
                and approachable.</p>

            <h3>Why It’s a Big Deal</h3>
            <p>Because having a clean, easy-to-navigate portfolio is clutch when you want to get noticed. Plus, it’s
                built using our
                new theme colors to keep everything consistent across TRIVEXUM. Customize it, add more projects,
                and flex your
                unique style!</p>

            <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
            <p>More mini projects coming your way — maybe a quiz app, a fitness tracker, or a random quote generator.
                Use this portfolio
                project as your hub to bring them all together.</p>

            <h3>Get Started Now!</h3>
            <p>Ready to take your portfolio to the next level? Dive into the new project, tweak it, and show the world
                what you’re made of.
                Because you’re not just coding — you’re building your future. 💪🔥</p>

            <h3>Keep the Momentum Going</h3>
            <p><span style="color: var(--color-primary);">TRIVEXUM</span> is growing every day, and your support
                and feedback keep it
                moving forward. Got ideas or want code for a new mini project? Hit me up — we’re in this journey
                together!</p>

            <h4 class="title">Introducing "Science from the Qur’an" + Our Brand New Blog Page!</h4>

            <h3>As-salamu Alaikum and Welcome!</h3>
            <p>We’re thrilled to launch the <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Science from the Qur’an</span>
                section — a
                powerful new
                addition to <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">TRIVEXUM</span>! But that’s not all… we’ve
                also
                officially added a
                <b>dedicated Blog Page</b> to make exploring these gems even smoother and more engaging. 📖✨
            </p>

            <h3>What’s "Science from the Qur’an" All About?</h3>
            <p>In this section, we dive into some mind-blowing facts from modern science — and how they were already
                mentioned
                in the <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Holy Qur’an</span> centuries ago. From astronomy and
                geology to
                biology and oceanography,
                this is all about reflecting on the divine wisdom that was always there, just waiting to be understood.
            </p>

            <h3>What to Expect in Each Post?</h3>
            <p><b>📘 Qur’anic Verse:</b> Every post highlights a clear verse with Arabic + English translation + proper
                reference.</p>
            <p><b>🔬 Modern Science:</b> We explain the scientific concept in simple words — so it clicks instantly!</p>
            <p><b>💭 Reflection:</b> A short discussion on how this verse inspires awe, curiosity, and deeper faith.</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters?</h3>
            <p>Because the Qur’an isn’t just a guide for the soul — it’s also a source of knowledge and observation.
                Allah ﷻ invites us again and again to "ponder", "reflect", and "observe". This section brings those
                verses to life.</p>

            <h3>Blog Page is LIVE!</h3>
            <p>With the launch of our new <b>Blog Page</b>, you can now explore all sections of TRIVEXUM —
                including
                tools, thoughts, and spiritual gems — in one clean, scrollable experience. 🖥️📝
                It’s all styled with care, keeping simplicity and readability front and center.</p>

            <h3>Let’s Explore the Signs Together 🌌</h3>
            <p>If you’ve ever read a verse and thought, “Wait... science says that too?” — this is the spot for you.
                Whether you’re a curious student, a believer in awe, or someone exploring the intersection of deen and
                dunya,
                this section is made with love — and with you in mind.</p>

            <h3>Check It Out Now!</h3>
            <p>Tap into the Qur’an’s depth, beauty, and knowledge. Visit the new blog and explore the posts in the
                <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Science from the Qur’an</span> series. More updates and posts
                are coming
                soon, inshaAllah!
            </p>

            <h3>JazakAllah Khair for Being Here</h3>
            <p><span style="color: var(--color-primary);">TRIVEXUM</span> is just getting started, and your
                support means the
                world. Stay curious, stay inspired —
                and don’t forget to reflect on the ayahs that speak louder than textbooks 📚❤️</p>
