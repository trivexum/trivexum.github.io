            <h3>Hey car enthusiasts and tech fam! 🔧🏎️</h3>
            <p>
                Big news from the Trivexum garage — <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Carveo</span> is now
                officially
                <b>LIVE</b>! 🎉 It’s your smart car info finder that helps you discover detailed specs, fuel economy,
                and
                performance data with just a quick search. No fluff, no endless scrolling — just clean and accurate car
                data. 😎
            </p>

            <h3>What is Carveo? 🚘</h3>
            <p>
                Carveo is your one-stop solution to look up cars by make, model, or year. It gives you instant access to
                everything you need to know:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>📅 Year, Make & Model</li>
                <li>🏷️ Car Class (midsize, SUV, truck, etc.)</li>
                <li>🔧 Engine Displacement & Cylinders</li>

                <li>⛽ Fuel Type & Fuel Economy (City / Highway / Combined MPG)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Carveo? 🌟</h3>
            <p>
                Let’s be real — finding reliable car details online is often a hassle. Carveo makes it fast, simple, and
                reliable:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Accurate structured data</li>
                <li>✅ Clean, no-nonsense UI</li>
                <li>✅ Quick lookups for students, developers, or car geeks</li>
                <li>✅ Perfect for buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts alike</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example Lookup 🔍</h3>
            <p>
                Search for <b>1993 Toyota Camry</b> and Carveo shows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>📊 2.2L 4-cylinder engine</li>
                <li>🚦 FWD with automatic transmission</li>
                <li>⛽ 18 mpg city / 26 mpg highway / 21 combined</li>
                <li>🏷️ Class: Midsize Car</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Built with the TRIVEXUM Theme 🖌️</h3>
            <p>
                Carveo rocks the same minimal and consistent theme as other Portico projects. It’s sleek, responsive,
                and super
                easy on the eyes. 😌
            </p>

            <h3>What’s Next? 👀</h3>
            <p>
                We’re already revving up for more features in future updates:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>🗂️ Advanced filters (by mpg, year, type, etc.)</li>

                <li>📱 Mobile-first UI upgrades</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Thoughts 💬</h3>
            <p>
                Carveo started as a simple idea — to make car data accessible in seconds. Now it’s live and ready to
                help anyone
                who loves cars, works with them, or just needs quick details without the headache. Try it out, explore
                it, and

            <h3>Hey word lovers and tech fam! 📚✨</h3>

                <b>mobile sidebar</b> to make LexiLookup feel super smooth on small screens. 🎉📱
            </p>

            <h3>What is LexiLookup? 🔤</h3>
            <p>
                It’s not your average dictionary. LexiLookup helps you explore and understand words like a boss:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>📖 Definitions</li>
                <li>🔊 Pronunciation (Audio included!)</li>

                Mobile users, you’re in for a treat! We’ve rolled out a brand-new <b>collapsible sidebar</b> that works
                like a
                charm on phones and tablets. Whether you're searching, snapping, or switching views, this sidebar has
                your
                back.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s what it brings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Slide-in design</li>

                <li>✅ Feels like a real app experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Built with the TRIVEXUM Theme 🖌️</h3>
            <p>Of course, it uses the same beautiful theme as the rest of Portico apps.</p>

            <p>It’s clean, consistent, and super easy on the eyes — just how we like it 😌</p>

            <h3>What’s Next? 👀</h3>

            </ul>

            <h3>Final Thoughts 💬</h3>
            <p>
                LexiLookup started as a simple idea — but now it’s a fully-featured word tool for curious learners,
                devs,
                writers,
                and anyone who’s ever typed "define ____" into a search bar. Try it, explore it, and don’t forget to
                share it
                with
                your crew. 💙

            <h4 class="title">TRIVEXUM Update: Rebrand, Dark Theme & New Sections Unleashed!</h4>

            <h3>Hey there, digital explorers! 🧑‍💻✨</h3>
            <p>The platform formerly known as <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Project Portico</span> has
                officially evolved into <b>TRIVEXUM</b> — a name that speaks to tech, curiosity, and boundless
                creativity. We’re not just rebranding… we’re redefining the vibe. 💥</p>

            <h3>What’s New?</h3>
            <p>Everything. Literally.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>✅ New name:</b> Say hello to <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">TRIVEXUM</span> — same
                    vision, way cooler branding.</li>
                <li><b>🧠 Fresh logo:</b> Sleek, bold, and built for the future.</li>
                <li><b>🏡 Revamped Homepage:</b> Now with featured projects, mini tools, blog previews, and even more ✨
                    personality.</li>
                <li><b>🙋‍♂️ About Page:</b> Real backstory, clear goals, and the whole Trivexum journey laid out.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌙 Dark Theme Activated</h3>
            <p>You asked. We listened. Dark mode is here and it's absolutely gorgeous. Check it out:</p>
            <pre style="background: var(--color-bg); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
<code>:root {
  --color-bg: #f9f9f9;
  --color-primary: #34495e;
  --color-secondary: #2c3e50;
  --color-accent: #2980b9;
  --color-text: #2d3436;
  --color-light-text: #7f8c8d;
  --color-border: #dfe6e9;
  --color-white: #ffffff;
}
</code>
        </pre>
            <p>And of course, there’s a dark variant with colors adjusted perfectly for those late-night coding sprints
                🌌</p>

            <h3>🎯 Reorganizing All Projects Under TRIVEXUM</h3>
            <p>No more separate names — all mini-projects now live under one unified umbrella: <b>TRIVEXUM</b>. That
                includes your faves like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>📝 <b>Scribbly</b> (Note app)</li>
                <li>📊 <b>SpendSense</b> (Expense tracker)</li>
                <li>🌍 <b>SpaceScale</b> (Planet age/weight calculator)</li>
                <li>🧠 <b>Divine Discoveries</b> (Qur’an meets science, in a simplified static version)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why This Update Slaps</h3>
            <p>This ain’t just a facelift — it’s a full-on evolution. Consistent theming, stronger UX, and a brand
                identity you can proudly build on. It’s like your dev portfolio just hit the gym and came out swole 💪
            </p>

            <h3>What’s Coming Next?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>⚙️ Theme switcher memory (so it remembers your dark/light choice)</li>
                <li>🔍 Search feature in Divine Discoveries</li>
                <li>🌐 Urdu/Arabic support</li>
                <li>📬 Newsletter + update signup system</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Words 💌</h3>
            <p><span style="color: var(--color-primary);">TRIVEXUM</span> is growing fast, and this rebrand sets the
                stage for even more creative, useful, and inspiring content. Thanks for being part of the journey —
                we’re just getting started!</p>

            <h4 class="title">Introducing "Science from the Qur’an" + Our Brand New Blog Page!</h4>

            <h3>As-salamu Alaikum and Welcome!</h3>
            <p>We’re thrilled to launch the <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Science from the Qur’an</span>
                section — a
                powerful new
                addition to <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">TRIVEXUM</span>! But that’s not all… we’ve
                also
                officially added a
                <b>dedicated Blog Page</b> to make exploring these gems even smoother and more engaging. 📖✨
            </p>

            <h3>What’s "Science from the Qur’an" All About?</h3>
            <p>In this section, we dive into some mind-blowing facts from modern science — and how they were already
                mentioned
                in the <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Holy Qur’an</span> centuries ago. From astronomy and
                geology to
                biology and oceanography,
                this is all about reflecting on the divine wisdom that was always there, just waiting to be understood.
            </p>

            <h3>What to Expect in Each Post?</h3>
            <p><b>📘 Qur’anic Verse:</b> Every post highlights a clear verse with Arabic + English translation + proper
                reference.</p>
            <p><b>🔬 Modern Science:</b> We explain the scientific concept in simple words — so it clicks instantly!</p>
            <p><b>💭 Reflection:</b> A short discussion on how this verse inspires awe, curiosity, and deeper faith.</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters?</h3>
            <p>Because the Qur’an isn’t just a guide for the soul — it’s also a source of knowledge and observation.
                Allah ﷻ invites us again and again to "ponder", "reflect", and "observe". This section brings those
                verses to life.</p>

            <h3>Blog Page is LIVE!</h3>
            <p>With the launch of our new <b>Blog Page</b>, you can now explore all sections of TRIVEXUM —
                including
                tools, thoughts, and spiritual gems — in one clean, scrollable experience. 🖥️📝
                It’s all styled with care, keeping simplicity and readability front and center.</p>

            <h3>Let’s Explore the Signs Together 🌌</h3>
            <p>If you’ve ever read a verse and thought, “Wait... science says that too?” — this is the spot for you.
                Whether you’re a curious student, a believer in awe, or someone exploring the intersection of deen and
                dunya,
                this section is made with love — and with you in mind.</p>

            <h3>Check It Out Now!</h3>
            <p>Tap into the Qur’an’s depth, beauty, and knowledge. Visit the new blog and explore the posts in the
                <span style="color: var(--color-primary);">Science from the Qur’an</span> series. More updates and posts
                are coming
                soon, inshaAllah!
            </p>

            <h3>JazakAllah Khair for Being Here</h3>
            <p><span style="color: var(--color-primary);">TRIVEXUM</span> is just getting started, and your
                support means the
                world. Stay curious, stay inspired —
